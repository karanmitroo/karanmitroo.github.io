       <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After procasting for more than an year now, I have finally setup my blog. This time I chose to use github pages for hosting the content as compared to deploying my own wordpress server which I did alomst 2 years back. This static site is built using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. I recently came to know about Hugo and since it has been written in Go I started exploring it. But spending time exploring it was yet another excuse of not setting up the blog. So I have planned to explore it side by side as I setup the blog and push some content. The good thing about hugo is that I will be writing all my posts in Markdown. Which gives me the freedom to switch to any other framework if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-am-i-writing-a-blog&#34;&gt;Why am I writing a blog?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, this is the second time I have started to write a blog. The major reason to write a blog is to make myself read more. This sounds weird right?! Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I used to write my first blog back in 2018, I made some really good observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, to write something I would have to read someting. So this puts me in a habit of exploring/ reading new content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because this blog is going to be present on the Internet I will have to put some efforts in understanding what I am going to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus all in all it helps me keep myself up to date in this fast moving world of Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-will-i-be-writing-about&#34;&gt;What will I be writing about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad you asked! Majorly, the posts are going to be about Tech. Reliability and Development are the two things I will be focussing on initially. As that is what I am into at the moment. But at the same time I would also post some random blogs here and there around anything interesting that I come across.&lt;/p&gt;
