    <h1 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h1>
<p>After procasting for more than an year now, I have finally setup my blog. This time I chose to use github pages for hosting the content as compared to deploying my own wordpress server which I did alomst 2 years back. This static site is built using <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a>. I recently came to know about Hugo and since it has been written in Go I started exploring it. But spending time exploring it was yet another excuse of not setting up the blog. So I have planned to explore it side by side as I setup the blog and push some content. The good thing about hugo is that I will be writing all my posts in Markdown. Which gives me the freedom to switch to any other framework if required.</p>
<h2 id="why-am-i-writing-a-blog">Why am I writing a blog?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, this is the second time I have started to write a blog. The major reason to write a blog is to make myself read more. This sounds weird right?! Let me explain.</p>
<p>When I used to write my first blog back in 2018, I made some really good observations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, to write something I would have to read someting. So this puts me in a habit of exploring/ reading new content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And because this blog is going to be present on the Internet I will have to put some efforts in understanding what I am going to write about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus all in all it helps me keep myself up to date in this fast moving world of Tech.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-be-writing-about">What will I be writing about?</h2>
<p>I am glad you asked! Majorly, the posts are going to be about Tech. Reliability and Development are the two things I will be focussing on initially. As that is what I am into at the moment. But at the same time I would also post some random blogs here and there around anything interesting that I come across.</p>
